# Neract 0.1.0

Neract is a very simple content management tool. It handles one list of Articles that may be written by one of any number of users. The public can only read the articles from the
list, and do simple searching. They can also see the log-in page. All creation of content-editor users will be done in the (Mongo)DB. They can log in, get an auth token that is
good for 1 day, and in v0.1.0 can snag and edit or delete any of the articles.


### Why's this so basic and lame?

I doubt anyone will want this as a product, but Neract is a solid playground for enhancing my .NET Core WebAPI 4 knowledge and expanding my React 17 skills.
