# Neract 0.1.0 - Server Side

Neract is a very simple content management tool. It handles one list of Articles that may be written by one of any number of users. The public can only read the articles from the
list, and do simple searching. Everything is taken care of on the Server-Side by a .NET 5.0 WebApi project with one WebService Endpoint specifically for CRUDing the articles. The
only other API Controller is for login/logout.


### Why's this so basic and lame?

I doubt anyone will want this as a product, but Neract is a solid playground for enhancing my .NET Core WebAPI 4 knowledge and expanding my React 17 skills.
